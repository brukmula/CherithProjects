                <h3>A brief overview of the Outline Bible Tool.</h3>
            </hgroup>
            <p>This tutorial will walk you through using the different features of the Outline Bible Tool.</p>
            <hgroup>
                <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
            </hgroup>
            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <h3>Step 1: Getting Started</h3>
            <p>When you first open the webpage, you should see a screen like this:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/outlineBible/fullScreen.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Full Screen</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>On the left most side of the page is a navigation bar with two icons.  Next to that navigation bar are three separate windows. The function of each window will be discussed further below.</p>
            <p>The first icon on the navigation bar (the three lines on top of each other) turns the visibility of the first window on and off.</p>
            <p>The second icon on the navigation bar looks like a box of files. This icon controls which translation of the Bible you are reading. As of writing this tutorial, the only available version is the ESV, but more will come in the near future.</p>

            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <h3>Step 2: Navigating The Windows</h3>
            <p> As mentioned before, there are three distinct windows on each of the websites. For the purposes of this tutorial we will go from left to right. </p>

            <h4><b>1. The Outline Bible Window</b></h4>
            <p>This window, (found next to the navigation bar) is where you can view the entire Bible in an outline
                form. The Outline Bible divides the Bible into different sections to help you better understand how the
                scripture is broken down.  Both the New and Old Testament have been divided into their own sections.
                To alternate back and forth between the two, simply click on the selection tab at the top of the window.
            </p>

            <figure>

                <figcaption>First Window Tabs</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Once you know what Testament you want to observe, you will see a list of sections with plus signs next to them.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/outlineBible/firstWindowTabsandContent.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>First Window Tabs</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Click on the plus icon next to any of the sections to see the subsections of that section.
                Different sections have different amounts of subsections, so some sections require more clicking than others.
            </p>

                <figcaption>First Window Tabs</figcaption>
            </figure>


            <p>As mentioned before, you can always collapse this window using the three lined icon on the navigation bar
            </p>

            <!-- Second Window  -->
            <h4><b>2: The Scripture Viewing Window</b></h4>
            <p>The second window that you will see in the app is the Scripture viewing window. This window is where the
                Scripture text will appear. At the top of the window you will see two tabs that look like this:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/outlineBible/secondWindowNavigation.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Second Window Navigation</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>If you click on the first tab, you will see the entire chapter or section you have selected from the
                first window. The verses that are covered by that section will be highlighted in green. Like so,
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/outlineBible/secondWindowSections.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Second Window Sections</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> You can scroll through and read the chapter as you please. </p>
            <p> Before going into the next tab, make sure you select a verse you want to focus on. You can do this simply by going through the chapter tab, and clicking on your target verse, this will change which verse the second tab is highlighted to.
            </p>

            <p>
                Below the tab selection is a gray navigation bar that has one item with two lines, one with three lines,
                and a left and right arrow. The two line one controls the contents of the third window, so we
                will ignore them for now. The arrows let you go through the scriptural text chapter by chapter.
                However, if you want to go to a different section of the scripture without clicking through,
                just revisit/reopen the Outline Window and you can change which section of scripture you are observing.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second tab is for breaking down the verses into their syntactic units in a tree form. If you click
                on the tab you should see the verse you selected from the previous tab, along with a + icon next to it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Click on the + next to the verse to  expand the verse by one level. If you want to expand the verse
                into all levels, hold the shift key on your keyboard and click on the plus button. This will show the entire verse broken down into all its levels. You can also right click on the + button to access a context menu that will give you the option of expanding to one level, or to all of the levels.
            </p>

            <p>The next section will explain how the verse is broken down and interpreted in the third window.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/outlineBible/verseSelect.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Verse Tab</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Similar to the other tab, this tab has a gray bar containing a few buttons. The first button is a switch.
                When it is on, the grammatical categories of the units at each level are shown.  After that are two arrows
                similar to the other window. They let you scroll through each of the verses.
            </p>

            <p>
                To give an example, below is an instance of Genesis 1:1 with all the grammatical instances turned on.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/outlineBible/grammaticalInstances.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Grammatical Instances</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                As  you can observe, each of the words are tagged with different constituent labels like prep, np, V,
                and so on. These represent prepositions, noun phrases and verbs respectively. To get a full list of
                all the labels, refer to our other tutorial
                <a href="https://prototypes.cherith.io/TutorialPages/versetree.html#constituentLabels"></a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some words in the verse text are in gray, such as the “the” in “the beginning”.  These words do not
                have a corresponding part in the original Hebrew or Greek texts.  They are added to make the translation
                grammatical or more understandable.
            </p>

            <h4><b>3: Verses, Phrases and Pericope window.</b></h4>

            <p>
                The third window is where you can access all the verses, pericopes or phrases that are related in meaning
                to the verse that you have selected. As mentioned earlier, the first tab of the second window has two
                buttons that control what is displayed in the third window.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/outlineBible/secondWindowNavigationLines.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Second Window Navigation Lines</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Based on the verse selected, the first button (the two lines) sets the third window to display similar verses.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/outlineBible/pericope.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Pericope Tab</figcaption>
            </figure>
 
            <p>
                These are verses that have similar meaning, context, or messages to the selected verse.
            </p>

            <p>
                The other button on the second window changes the window's content to <b>Pericopes</b>.
                A pericope is a set of verses that form a coherent unit of narration or thought. This could be a  chapter,
                or a paragraph or even one verse. Clicking on the button with three lines will display all of the pericopes
                that are related to the verse you selected.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/outlineBible/thirdWindowVerses.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Third Window Verses Tab</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Both options also have a blue slider on the top right corner of the Verse/Pericope tab.
                This slider controls the number of verses/pericopes that show up at once. The verses/pericopes are ordered
                according to their similarity scores. The farther you slide it to the right, the more pericopes (the ones with lower scores)
                will be displayed.
            </p>

            <p>
                In both instances you should see a second tab at the top of the window labeled <b>'Phrases.'</b> This tab
                displays the verse in its original language, the Strong numbers of each word under it, and the verse in
                different translations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Under the <b>Phrases</b> tab, is a section of the original text with the strong numbers of each word under it.
                And below that are two sub tabs labeled <b>Versions</b> and <b>Concordance.</b> The <b>Versions</b> tab will
                display all the available translation of the selected verse in both English and Chinese.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/outlineBible/phrasesVersions.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Third Window Verses Tab</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
               The <b>Concordance</b> tab shows how the given Hebrew/Greek word/phrase is translated in different places
                in the current translation (ESV in this case). Each different translation has a number next to it indicating the number of
                times this translation occurs will be displayed in the window below.
            </p>
