                <h3>A brief overview of the related pericope lookup tool.</h3>
            </hgroup>
            <p>This tutorial will guide you through using the related pericope tool.</p>
            <p>A <b>pericope</b> is a set of verses  that form a coherent unit of narration or thought. This could be a chapter, or a paragraph or even one verse .</p>
            <p>The <b>related</b> verses or pericopes either have similar meanings or contain similar words/phrases. They provide associations between different parts of the Bible to enrich connections and extensions of ideas during Bible study.</p>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
            </hgroup>
            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <h3>Step 1: Choosing a Version</h3>
            <p>When you first open the website, you should see a bar that looks like this at the top:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/pericope/pericopeNavBar.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Navigation Bar</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The default setting for this bar is the Chinese translation. However, you can switch it to the NIV translation by selecting the dropdown menu next to the green toggle switch.</p>

            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <h3>Step 2: Select a Verse</h3>
            <p>On that same navigation bar, is a small green book logo. Click this logo to open the verse selection tool and select a verse.</p>
            <p>Regardless of what book you choose, the chapter containing that verse will be opened, like this: </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/pericope/pericopeVerseDisplay.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Verse Display</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If you have the green toggle switch on, you will notice that the verse you selected will expand the pericope that contains the verse. It will have a title above it. This is called a <b>Pericope Heading.</b> </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/pericope/pericopeVersePericope.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Verse Display</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In the image above, the Pericope Heading is <b>The Beginning</b></p>
            <p>Since pericopes can vary in length, the green highlighted text spans all verses within the current pericope. Click on any verse in it to see the associated pericope.</p>
            <!-- Step 3: Pericope Observation -->
            <h3>Step 3: Related Pericope Lookup</h3>
            <p>Now that you have selected a verse/pericope, the pane on the right side will show the verses/pericopes that are related in meaning. </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/pericope/pericopeDisplay.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Pericope Display</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The <b>Related pericopes</b> section will return all the related pericopes throughout the bible, listed from the more related ones to less related ones. If you look above the right hand corner of the displayed pericopes, you should see a small gray slider.</p>
            <p>This slider determines how many pericopes are displayed. By default, it will show all of them, but if you want to display the ones that are closer to the current text, just slide it towards the right, and the number of displayed pericopes will decrease.</p>
            <p>Do note that some verses/pericopes don't have related Pericopes.</p>
