            <p>This tutorial will guide you through using the concordance web application.</p>

            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <h3>Step 1: Selecting A Version</h3>
            <p>When you first enter the website, you should be led to a light blue navigation bar. On the right side of the navigation bar is a toggle switch and selection menu that looks like this</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/concordance/concordanceLanguageSelect.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Verse Select</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The toggle switch turns on and off the <a href = "versetree.html#constituentLabels">constituent labels</a>. This will be shown further in <b>Step 3.</b></p>
            <p>Next to the toggle switch is a dropdown navigation bar that lets you select which bible translation you want to use.</p>
            <p>Currently, there are three translation available. (more translations to be added)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>English Standard Version</li>
                <li>新标点和合本 (Chinese Union Version), and</li>
                <li>Nestle-Aland 28 (Original Greek of the New Testament verses)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your selection will determine which version is displayed.</p>
            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <h3>Step 2: Selecting a Verse</h3>
            <p> On the left side of the light blue navigation bar is a section that looks like this.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/concordance/concordanceVerseSelect.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Verse Select</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This section lets you select the verse you want to see. You can either type in the verse reference (e.g. Genesis 1:1), or you can use the little book icon next to it to select the verse.</p>
            <p>If you choose to type in the verse reference, you can also type in shorthand versions of the book. (e.g. Gen or Gn for Genesis)</p>
            <p>The arrows let you go to the previous or next verse of the current verse.</p>
            <!-- Step 3 -->
            <h3>Step 3: Unfolding the Verse</h3>
            <p>Once you have selected a verse, the web app will display the verse in the left hand box of the webpage. Here is an example:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/concordance/concordanceVerse.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Concordance Verse</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>You should be able to see a small plus sign (+) next to the verse that is being displayed. Keep pressing the plus sign to break down the verse into smaller subsections.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/concordance/concordanceVerseBreakdown.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Concordance Verse Subsections</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> If you want to bring the parts back together, just click the minus sign (-) and it will return them to the previous level.</p>
            <p> If you turn on the toggle switch from <b>Step 1</b> you will see little boxes next to each subsection that shows its <a href = "versetree.html#constituentLabels" target = "_blank">constituent labels</a>.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/concordance/concordanceToggle.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Toggle Constituent </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Step 4: Concordance Search</h3>
            <p>Now that you have broken down the verse to your liking, you should notice that some words are grayed out and the others words aren't.he words in black all have corresponding words in the manuscript, while the gray ones are added in the translation either to reflect the morphology of the manuscript words or to meet the grammatical requirements of the translation language.
            </p>
            <p>If a subsection contains words that are not grayed out, click on it and a page should appear on the right hand side of the screen.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/concordance/concordanceView.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Concordance Search</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>At the top of the pane, you will see a large Hebrew or Greek word/phrase with its Strong number(s) beneath it, which is the original text which is the original text the subsection is translated from.</p>
            <p>Under that is a series of tabs that lead you to different study tools for the selected subsection. There are up to 4 tabs per selected text.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Versions:</b>  Translations of the selected section in different versions.  Each different translation may cover a different aspect of its meaning, thus providing a more rounded understanding of the text. </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Concordance: </b>This lets you go through all instances of the selected text and see how it is translated in the whole Bible. Select a translation that pops up in this section, and all the verses where this particular translation of the manuscript text occurs will be displayed in the bottom section of the webpage.

                <li>
                    <b>Similar Phrases in OT/NT: </b>This lets you explore words/phrases which come from manuscript texts in that are different from the one at the top of the pane but are similar or related in meaning. Those similar phrases can be in both the New and Old Testaments.
