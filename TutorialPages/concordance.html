            <p>Next to the toggle switch is a dropdown navigation bar that lets you select which bible translation you want to use.</p>
            <p>Currently there are three translation available.</p>

                <li>Nestle-Aland 28 (Original Greek. Only available for New Testament verses)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You're selection will determine which version is displayed.</p>
            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <h3>Step 2: Selecting a Verse</h3>
            <p> On the left side of the light blue navigation bar is a section that looks like this.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/concordance/concordanceVerseSelect.png" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Verse Select</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This section lets you select the verse you want to see. You can either type in the name of the book followed by the chapter and verse, or you can use the little book icon next to it to select the verse manually.</p>
            <p>If you choose to type in the verse, it is recommended to type in the full book name to make sure it shows up.</p>
            <p>The arrows let you scroll through different versions</p>
            <!-- Step 3 -->
            <h3>Step 3: Verse Breakdown</h3>
            <p>Once you have selected a verse, the web app will display the verse in the left hand box of the webpage. Here is an example:</p>

            </figure>
            <p>You should be able to see a small plus sign (+) next to the verse that is being displayed. Keep pressing the plus sign to break down the verse into smaller subsections.</p>

            </figure>
            <p> If you want to bring the parts back together, just click the minus sign (-) and it will return them to the previous iteration.</p>
            <p> If you turn on the toggle switch from <b>Step 1</b> you will see little boxes next to each subsection. This will display the <a href = "versetree.html#constituentLabels" target = "_blank">constituent labels</a>.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Concordance Search</h3>
            <p>Now that you have broken down the verse to your liking, you should notice that some words are greyed out and the others words aren't.</p>
            <p>If a word isn't greyed out, click on it and a page should appear on the right hand side of the screen.</p>
