            </hgroup>
            <p>This app is created to help you improve your Bible memorization skills.</p>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <h3>Step 1: Getting Started</h3>
            <p>When you first open the app, you should see this navigation bar: </p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Navigation Bar</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>To get started, looking on the right side of the navigation bar, you should see a toggle switch, a difficulty selector, and a version selector. </p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>The green toggle switch controls sound effects, simply click on the switch to turn it off and on. </p>
            <p>The selection tool labeled "Easy" lets you choose the level of difficulty. This will be explained further in <b>Step 3</b>.</p>
            <p>To select which translation you would like to use, you can look at the dropdown next to the difficulty selector and select the preferred language/translation you would like to use.</p>
            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <h3>Step 2: Selecting a verse</h3>
            <p>On the left hand side of the navigation bar, you should see a small box and a green book icon.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/memory/memoryBarLeft.PNG" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Navigation Bar Left</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This section lets you select the verse you want to see. You can either type in the verse reference (e.g. Genesis 1:1), or you can use the little book icon next to it to select the verse.</p>
            <p>If you choose to type in the verse reference, you can also type in shorthand versions of the book (e.g. Gen or Gn for Genesis)</p>
            <p>Another way to select your desired Verse is by clicking on the green book button next to the text box. After clicking on it, you should see a screen like this: </p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Bible Verse Display</figcaption>
            </figure>
             <p>The verse search option gives three categories to browse through.</p>
            <p><b>Top verses</b> will display different verses based on themes. For example in the example above the themes listed include Love, Lord, God, Prayer, etc...</p>
            <p>The <b>Bible </b>tab will give you a selection screen to let you choose the Bible verse you would like to see displayed.</p>
            <p>The <b>Pericopes</b> option will show you different <a href="versereferences.html#pericopeDefinition" target="_blank">pericopes</a> available throughout the Bible.</p>
            <p>Click on your desired verse or pericope to quiz yourself on. The text should appear in the white area under the navigation bar.</p>
            <!-- Additional steps as needed -->
            <h3>Step 3: Beginning the Quiz</h3>
            <p>Now that you have selected a verse/pericope, you can begin playing. In the navigation bar clock on the orange play button. This will shuffle the text around. </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/tutorials/memory/memoryShuffle.PNG" alt="Step 1 Illustration" />
                <figcaption>Shuffled Verse</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The verse you chose will break down into different segments, and then shuffle itself up. The <b>Difficulty</b> you selected in Step 1 will determine how fragmentary the segments will be. The harder the level, the more segments the verse will be split up and shuffled.</p>
            <p>If you chose a pericope, the sentences within the pericope will be shuffled. The <b>Difficulty</b> level is disabled when pericope is selected, since it shuffles by sentences, not by words.</p>
            <p>To play, simply put the shuffled verses/sentences in order. If the text is in the right place, the yellow box will disappear and the white background will return.</p>
            <p>To return to the original verse, the stop button (where the play button was) will return it to the original text. </p>
            <p>Once you have gotten the answer correct, you should see an animation with the following image show up: </p>
