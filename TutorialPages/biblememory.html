            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <h3>Step 1: Getting Started</h3>
            <p>When you first open the app, you should see this navigation bar: </p>

            </figure>
            <p>To get started, looking on the right side of the navigation bar, you should see a toggle switch, a difficulty selector, and a version selector. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>The green toggle switch controls sound effects, simply click on the switch to turn it off and on. </p>
            <p>The selection tool labeled "Easy" lets you choose the level of difficulty. This will be explained further in <b>Step 3</b>.</p>
            <p>To select which translation you would like to use, you can look at the dropdown next to the difficulty selector and select the preferred language/translation you would like to use.</p>
            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <h3>Step 2: Selecting a verse</h3>
            <p>On the left hand side of the navigation bar, you should see a small box and a green book icon.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>If you would like to type in the verse manually, you can enter the book name followed by chapter and verse in the white text box. It is recommended to enter the full book name.</p>
            <p>Another way to select your desired Verse is by clicking on the green book button next to the text box. After clicking on it, you should see a screen like this: </p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Navigation Bar Left</figcaption>
            </figure>
             <p>The verse search option gives three categories to browse through.</p>
            <p><b>Top verses</b> will display different verses based on themes. For example in the example above the themes listed include Love, Lord, God, Prayer, etc...</p>
            <p>The <b>Bible </b>tab will give you a selection screen to let you choose the Bible verse you would like to see displayed.</p>
            <p>The <b>Pericopes</b> option will show you different <a href="versereferences.html#pericopeDefinition" target="_blank">pericopes</a> available throughout the Bible.</p>
            <p>Click on your desired verse or pericope to quiz yourself on. The text should appear in the white area under the navigation bar.</p>
            <!-- Additional steps as needed -->
            <h3>Step 3: Beginning the Quiz</h3>
            <p>Now that you have selected a verse/pericope, you can begin playing. In the navigation bar clock on the orange play button. This will shuffle the text around. </p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Navigation Bar Left</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If you chose a verse, the verse will break down into different segments, and then shuffle itself up. The <b>Difficulty</b> you selected in Step 1 will determine how many segments. The harder the level, the more segments that are split up and shuffled.</p>
            <p>If you chose a pericope, the sentences within the pericope will be shuffled. The <b>Difficulty</b> level is disabled when pericope is selected, since it shuffles by sentences, not by words.</p>
            <p>To play, simply put the shuffled verses/sentences in order. If the text is in the right place, the yellow box will disappear and the white background will return.</p>
            <p>To return to the original verse, the stop button (where the play button was) will return it to the original text. </p>
            <p>Once you have gotten the answer correct, you should see an animation with the following image show up: </p>
